# Maze Game

A simple maze game that has a random starting and ending point.

## How to play:

Your goal is to get to the end.

"pp" represents you, the player.

"[]" represents the places you have already been.

"██" represents a wall that you can't go through.

**Moving:**

The "W" "A" "S" "D" keys are used for moving up, left, down, and right respectively. To move simply enter your key of choice into the prompt `What direction do you want to move? (w,a,s,d )` which shows up after the program has been run.
